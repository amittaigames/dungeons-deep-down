# Dungeons Deep Down

A simple text based game written in C.
Read the included project.pdf file for more information about the game.
The game can be compiled by running ```make``` in the master directory.
Running ```make clean``` will remove executables and object files.
If you'd like a larger map, in the main.c file, change the GRID_SIZE constant to a different number (works by squaring that number) before compilation.
